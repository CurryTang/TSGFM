      "EphA4 is a member of the large Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The signaling ability of EphA4, and the other nine closely related EphA receptors, is activated by binding the six GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands. In addition, EphA4 also binds the three transmembrane ephrin-B ligands, which are the ligands for the other class of Eph receptors, the EphB receptors (EphB1-EphB6). Eph receptor-ephrin interaction requires cell-cell contact because both the receptor and the ligand are membrane-bound. Importantly, signals are generated both through the Eph receptor kinase domain (forward signals) and through signaling molecules associated with the ephrins (reverse signals). The EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in the inhibition of axon regeneration that occurs after spinal cord injury. Axons in EphA4 knockout mice can regenerate past the site of injury and re-establish severed connections resulting in functional recovery. Other evidence suggests that EphA4 plays an inhibitory role in axonal and dendritic growth in other regions of the central nervous system as well. Furthermore, EphA4 has been implicated in the maintenance of platelet aggregation during thrombus formation and in prostate cancer cell growth. Thus, inhibiting EphA4 function is a very promising new approach with high potential for a number of therapeutic applications. Is this molecule inhibitor of EphA4?",

      "The study aimed to find small molecule probes that specifically kill cancer cells with p53 mutations. They used H1299 lung cancer cells with a mutant p53 and a control cell line without the mutation. They identified compounds that selectively target mutant p53-containing cancer cells using a cytotoxicity assay based on ATP content measurement. They determined concentration-responses of all compounds using a high-throughput screening method with the cell lines and temperature conditions. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

      "The assay involves using splice-switching oligonucleotides to modulate aberrant and alternative splicing in HeLa cells that express a construct with mutated EGFP caused by mis-splicing. Restoration of proper splicing resulted in full-length, functional EGFP protein which generated a fluorescent signal. The cells can be used for high-throughput screening of a chemical library. Modulation of abnormal splicing with SSOs provides a promising target for treatment of diseases associated with abnormal splicing. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

      "The assay measures the activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cAMP production in HEK 293 cells expressing the TSH receptor upon stimulation with TSH. A fluorescent membrane potential dye is used to detect cAMP stimulation, and parental cells without the TSH receptor are used as a control. The assay is used to study the growth and function of thyroid follicular cells. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

      "The assay detects inhibitors of USP2a, a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the ubiquitination of cellular proteins. It involves attaching a ubiquitin-like protein to a reporter enzyme, which is then cleaved by USP2, activating the reporter enzyme and producing a fluorescent read-out. The assay has been developed by Progenra, Inc. and is sold as the Ub-IsoPro1 kit by LifeSensors, Inc. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

      "The assay used a biosensor called the cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel to detect cAMP induction, which causes the channel to open and membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent dye was used to detect cAMP stimulation in cells. The cells were kept in a specific medium and the assay was used as a counterscreen to control for compounds signaling through other targets of HEK 293 cells. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

      "The assay detects ERK phosphorylation, which is involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus and plays a key role in cell division and survival. The assay uses AlphaScreen technology and specific antibodies to detect phosphorylated ERK, and it is suitable for high throughput screening. The assay can be used in basic research and drug discovery, especially for cancer chemotherapy. A counter-screen is used to exclude false positives. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"
